## What is ndpc?

Ndpc introduced a markup language for creating [natural deduction](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction) proofs for propositional logic and classical first order logic, with support for validation, formatting, and exporting to HTML.

Compared to existing similar tools, ndpc is easier to use and looks much more similar to hand written proofs.
